              We focus our investing on Indian deep tech companies across sectors. We believe a deep tech company is one
              whose moat is its cutting-edge technology that differentiates it from its competitors. And our investments
              in the past have been in close alignment with this belief, with some of them even going public, listing in
              Indian stock exchanges.{' '}
            </p>
            <p>
              Our involvement with companies doesnâ€™t end with funding; we offer support and mentoring that helps them go
              to market. Sectors that excite us most include semiconductor, robotics, smart manufacturing, and genomics
              to name a few.
