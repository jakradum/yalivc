              Our conviction in the potential and success of the deep tech domain comes from our first-hand
              understanding of it. Our experience in founding and operating deep tech companies, along with our
              experience with previous investments in drone and semiconductor tech tells us we can take bets and take
              big ones while at it. At Yali Capital, our focus is on IP-led deep tech companies in the early stages of
              their growth.
